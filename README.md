## Features
Well your browsing may not be completely ad free becuase I am still conquering ads. I now conquered so many ad providing URLs that it is to many to list. If you find a site that has ads that aren't yet blocked please create an Issue to tell me. You can also use a Fork to help me develop Ad-B-Gone.
